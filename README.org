I couldn't figure out how *not* to download all ~sources~ before building, and you really don't wanna do that with multiple gigabytes of data.

Just ~python generate.py~. This will overwrite the individual ~PKGBUILD~ files and commit them. You can use --push to push to the aur repos.


Then just go through the ~models/~ subdirectory and build models that you want -- or just install from AUR.
